## 3. General description <br>
“JIJ” is a booking website in Jericho city, it has three locations for the tourist: hotels, hostel and the chalet. “ JIJ” leads them to tourist attractions, and helps the tourists with several services they need.
### 3.1 Problem Statement:
We want to provide a tourist reference in Jericho by reserving a place for temporary residence, without defects, and to keep the tourist informed of the updates of his request.<br>
These days, we have large number failure cases in booking, such as not covering all overnight places in the city that lead to cases of financial injustice and commercial monopoly of the distinct places and ignore the rest of the places and attractions. <br>
If we ignore this kind of problem, many resources will need to increase in order to deal with successive problems, and it may miss customer trips that could lead to revenue loss, business loss, and more damage to our local reputation. <br>
### 3.2 Why is the project worthwhile and practical ? 
1. The site is specialized in Jericho, which gives better search results.
2. Educating users about the tourist attractions in Jericho, especially the less visited ones.
3. Reduce using social media such as Facebook in booking.
4. It provides other services for tourists, such as carrying luggage, providing safe transportation inside and outside the city, and a tour guide.
5. Organizing business, cultural, religious, beach, therapeutic and heritage trips.
6. Provide different payment methods that suit the user.
## 4. Competitive analysis
### 4.1 Primary Competitors

4. showing a lot of problems in the app and websites and how can our website avoid them: <br>
  -The system is not good enough because others book 2 rooms for 4 people and they end up paying for 4 rooms not 2 which is a big problem that we are going to be avoiding by excellent management.
5. not being able to refund the booking <br>
  - When the customer wants to cancel his booking before a good amount of time of booking in because of some emergency he cannot get his money back, but in our website the customer can get his money back.

4. Showing a lot of problems in the app and websites and how can our website avoid them: <br>
  -Not being able to refund the bookings and the flights is a big issue, but in our website the customer gets his money back easily. <br>
  -some users book up rooms, pay for it and the app tells them that it has been successfully booked, then they receive a message that it wasn't confirmed and can't get their money back, and that a big problem that we are avoiding in our website by good arranging the orders.
 
##### Looking at all of these issues in the other applications
1. We can have a huge advantage above them by fixing the issues.
2. We will fix the problems in the site before even the audience uses it.
### 4.2 Secondary Competitors
- Kayak: <br>
 is a travel agency and metasearch engine owned and operated by Booking Holdings. <br>
 The company also runs travel search engines checkfelix, Mundi, Hotels Combined, and swoodoo. Kayak was founded in January 2004 by Steve Hafner and Paul M. English.
- Airbnb: <br>
is an American vacation rental online marketplace company based in San Francisco, California, United States. Airbnb offers arrangements for lodging, primarily homestays, or tourism experiences. <br>
The company does not own any of the real estate listings, nor does it host events; it acts as a broker, receiving commissions from each booking.
- HotelsCombined: <br>
 a unit of Booking Holdings, is a hotel metasearch engine founded in 2005, with headquarters in Sydney, Australia. The site operates in over 42 languages, handles 130 different currencies and aggregates more than 2 million deals from hundreds of travel sites and hotel chains. The company employs over 200 staff.
- There is one more site but this one we can count as a site that we can work with rather than being competitive with, which is Trivago. Trivago is a site that compares the hotels prices from different sites from around the world.
### 4.3 Risks
We are taking some risks facing these competitors because of some advantages they have on us such as:
- These sites give the user the ability to book flights to their destination but due to the lack of aviation in Palestine we can’t feature it in ours.
- Our site is going to be new to the market and the majority of the people use their favorite site, it's going to be a bit difficult to convince people to use our site. The advantage we have in this situation is that we are focusing only on Jericho.
## 5. The audience of the site
Most of our audience are people looking for a place where they stay in Jericho, each user has different needs depending on the reason for the visit. We have four kinds of users: citizens, travellers, business-trip travellers, business-trip companies and exchange volunteers. <br>
Citizens are most likely to search for chalets, business-trip travellers and companies are most likely to search for hotels, travellers and exchange volunteers are most likely to search for hostels and hotels. <br>
Here are our user personas. <br>
